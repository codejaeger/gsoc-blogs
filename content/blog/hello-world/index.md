### TL;DR
This site will contain the following:-

1. Technical posts
2. Coding experiences
3. Project demonstrations
4. Challenges/Quizzes for the more daring folks
5. Concept/Topic explanations

That being said, if you are still willing to know more about what to expect under each banner 
follow along.

## Motivation

* Sharing is caring ;-)
* Knowledge shared is knowledge gained!
* Keep track of what I learn and record how long I can retain it.

## Contents

### Technical posts

Ideally, I would like to cover topics spanning multiple areas in computer science. However, due to my current priorities and interests you may find a positive bias towards AI, ML and computer vision concepts. If you are looking for something similar great let's get going else look into the challenge/quizzes section. That part should be for everyone :-)

### Coding Experiences

This is something I have been thinking of doing for a long time. Often, we stumble across complex problems while working which with some amount of hard thinking we can find a solution to. These nameless problems are important additions to our experiences. Replicating these problems, become very difficult due to hidden source codes, too many dependent components, random aha! moments without any clear explanations (pun intended) etc. Instead of losing these to the sands of time, maybe I could create sandbox environments for such problems and let others try it out and find solutions to. Sometimes, it might just be a thought-provoking question without a clear answer from my side.

### Project demonstrations

I love working on open source projects, hobby projects and projects to help humanity! In the past I have found my work not attracting too many views in spite of working hard on them. I identified my mistake in failing to advertise them on popular platforms and producing eye-catchy themes and posts for my work. This time I decided I shall blog about all my mini as well as large projects.

### Challenges/Quizzes

This part is inspired from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) by Eric Wastl. The idea here is to occasionally release uncommon puzzles related to computer science and mathematics. Rewards :- Nothing decided yet, but who knows what I come up with ;-)

### Concept explanations

Finally, the reason why a tech blog site is used most of the times. Concepts explained in a neat and crisp manner with sufficient illustrations is one of the major inspirations for this site. The hunt now is just for a theme and a style of explaining that will be unique to this site.
